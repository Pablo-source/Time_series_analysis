# Time_series_analysis
Time series analysis using git and github based on publically available NHS data

This is a new project to practise working with a local git repo and also with a new GitHub repository, so I can use the terminal to commit all changes of the scripts I am tracking 

Currently working from RStudio using the Terminal tab available to commit all the scrpts changes to both git and GitHub
