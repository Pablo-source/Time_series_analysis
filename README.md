# Time_series_analysis

This is a new project to practise different packages used for Time Series Analysis.

The aim is to learn Time series analysis in a Tidy way, comparing several models at once. 

For this reason I will start exploring TSStudio: <https://github.com/RamiKrispin/TSstudio>

This package allows us to compare multiple Time Series model side by side
